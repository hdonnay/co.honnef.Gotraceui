		<p>
			Gotraceui is a tool for visualizing and analyzing Go execution traces.
			It is meant to be a faster, more accessible, and more powerful alternative to <pre>go tool trace</pre>.
			Unlike <pre>go tool trace</pre>, Gotraceui doesnâ€™t use deprecated browser APIs (or a browser at all), and its UI is tuned specifically to the unique characteristics of Go traces.

			<description>
				<p>
					This is the first release of Gotraceui, the efficient frontend for Go execution traces.
					It is the culmination of nine months of work and over 700 commits.
				</p>
				<p>
					The attached PDF is a manual explaining most aspects of Gotraceui, including how to install it.
				</p>
				<p>
					All of the essential features are there and Gotraceui should be a better alternative to <pre>go tool trace</pre> in 90% of cases.
					Nevertheless, this is only the beginning.
