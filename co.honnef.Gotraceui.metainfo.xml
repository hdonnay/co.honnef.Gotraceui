		<p>
			Gotraceui is a tool for visualizing and analyzing Go execution traces.
			It is meant to be a faster, more accessible, and more powerful alternative to <pre>go tool trace</pre>.
			Unlike <pre>go tool trace</pre>, Gotraceui doesnâ€™t use deprecated browser APIs (or a browser at all), and its UI is tuned specifically to the unique characteristics of Go traces.

					<li>Switch to a tabbed user interface instead of using multiple windows</li>
					<li>Added a Goroutines tab that lists all goroutines in the trace</li>
					<li>Panels can be converted into tabs</li>
					<li>Added context menu to goroutine labels in timelines view</li>
					<li>No longer create empty GC or STW timelines</li>
					<li>Merged spans now display a detailed representation of the contained spans</li>
					<li>Fixed a rare crash at startup</li>
					<li>Fixed a rare crash for some traces</li>
					<li>Handle DPI changes while Gotraceui is running</li>
					<li>Display user-friendly strings instead of "unknown" for unknown timestamps</li>
					<li>Hovered and highlighted spans are now indicated with a gradient instead of the border color</li>
					<li>Span borders more accurately show if the span's beginning or end are outside the visible area</li>
					<li>Merged spans no longer stop at the screen boundaries</li>
					<li>Lowered peak memory usage</li>

		</release>
		<release version="0.1.0" date="2023-03-30" type="stable">
			<description>
				<p>
					This is the first release of Gotraceui, the efficient frontend for Go execution traces.
					It is the culmination of nine months of work and over 700 commits.
				</p>
				<p>
					The attached PDF is a manual explaining most aspects of Gotraceui, including how to install it.
				</p>
				<p>
					All of the essential features are there and Gotraceui should be a better alternative to <pre>go tool trace</pre> in 90% of cases.
					Nevertheless, this is only the beginning.
